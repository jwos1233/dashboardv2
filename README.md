# Macro Quadrant Rotation Strategy

**Advanced algorithmic portfolio allocation system based on macroeconomic regime detection**

## Overview

This strategy dynamically allocates capital across multiple asset classes by identifying and trading the dominant macroeconomic quadrants. It combines momentum-based regime detection, volatility targeting, asymmetric leverage, and intelligent entry confirmation to deliver exceptional risk-adjusted returns.

### Key Features

1. **Macro Quadrant Framework** - Classifies markets into 4 regimes based on growth and inflation dynamics
2. **Volatility Chasing** - Dynamically allocates more capital to higher-volatility assets
3. **Asymmetric Leverage** - Overweights the best-performing quadrant (Q1 Goldilocks)
4. **Trend Filtering** - 50-day EMA filter ensures alignment with prevailing trends
5. **Entry Confirmation** - 1-day lag on entries using live EMA data to filter false breakouts
6. **Event-Driven Rebalancing** - Only trades when signals change (not on a fixed schedule)

## Performance (4-Year Backtest)

| Metric | **This Strategy** | **S&P 500 (SPY)** | **Difference** |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Total Return** | **458.22%** | 158.90% | **+299.32%** |
| **Annualized Return** | **44.02%** | 20.75% | **+23.28%** |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | **1.37** | 1.18 | **+0.18** |
| **Max Drawdown** | **-28.60%** | -24.50% | -4.10% |
| **Volatility** | 32.15% | 17.52% | +14.63% |

**Outperforms S&P 500 by 299% over 4 years with superior risk-adjusted returns**

## Strategy Components

### 1. Quadrant Classification

Markets are classified into 4 macroeconomic regimes based on momentum of key indicators:

- **Q1 (Goldilocks)**: Growth UP, Inflation DOWN - Tech/Growth equities, Long-duration bonds
- **Q2 (Reflation)**: Growth UP, Inflation UP - Commodities, Cyclicals, Energy
- **Q3 (Stagflation)**: Growth DOWN, Inflation UP - Energy, Gold, TIPS, Defensive
- **Q4 (Deflation)**: Growth DOWN, Inflation DOWN - Long bonds, Credit, Utilities, Cash

**Quadrant Performance (Historical):**
- **Q1**: +82.70% cumulative (631 days active) - BEST
- **Q3**: +39.54% cumulative (520 days active)
- **Q2**: +34.59% cumulative (467 days active)
- **Q4**: -18.64% cumulative (256 days active)

### 2. Asymmetric Leverage (KEY INNOVATION)

**The Game-Changer**: Not all quadrants are equal. We moderately overweight the winner.

- **Q1 (Goldilocks)**: 150% allocation
- **Q2/Q3/Q4**: 100% allocation each

**Why it works:**
- Q1 has historically been the best-performing quad (+82.70% vs +34-40% for others)
- When Q1 is active, we overweight it 1.5x to capture tech/growth alpha
- When Q1 is not active, we maintain standard 2x leverage (100% + 100%)
- **Optimal balance**: Captures Q1 outperformance without excessive drawdown risk

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Q1 + Q2 Active**: 150% (Q1) + 100% (Q2) = **250% total leverage**
- **Q1 + Q3 Active**: 150% (Q1) + 100% (Q3) = **250% total leverage**
- **Q2 + Q3 Active**: 100% (Q2) + 100% (Q3) = **200% total leverage** (standard)

**Result**: +299% outperformance vs S&P 500 with manageable drawdowns

### 3. Volatility Chasing

**Second Innovation**: Allocates **MORE** to volatile assets (opposite of risk parity).

**How it works:**
- Calculate 30-day rolling volatility for all assets
- Within each active quadrant, weight assets directly by their volatility
- Higher vol = Higher weight (volatility chasing, not dampening)
- **30-day lookback** found optimal through testing (20/30/50/60 day comparison)

**Why it works:**
- In trending markets, volatility = opportunity
- High-vol assets deliver outsized returns when trends are strong
- Combined with EMA filter, we only chase volatility in confirmed uptrends

### 4. Entry Confirmation (CRITICAL EDGE)

**Third Innovation**: 1-day lag on entries using **CURRENT** EMA data.

**Lag Structure:**
- **Macro Signals (Quad Rankings)**: T-1 lag (trade yesterday's regime)
  - Prevents forward-looking bias in regime detection
- **Entry Confirmation**: T+0 (check TODAY's live EMA)
  - Wait 1 day and confirm asset STILL above EMA before entering
  - Filters false breakouts and whipsaw trades
- **Exit Rule**: Immediate (no lag)

**Impact:**
- **25.7% rejection rate** - filters out bad entries effectively
- Dramatically improves returns (+130% vs no lag)
- Better Sharpe ratio (1.37 vs 0.80 without confirmation)

### 5. Trend Filter (50-Day EMA)

**Simple but powerful**: Only allocate to assets trading above their 50-day EMA.

- Assets below EMA get zero weight (held as cash)
- Cash is NOT redistributed to other assets
- Reduces leverage in bear markets automatically
- Event-driven: rebalance when assets cross EMA

### 6. Event-Driven Rebalancing

Trades ONLY when signals change:

1. Top 2 quadrants change, **OR**
2. An asset crosses its 50-day EMA (up or down), **OR**
3. Entry confirmation triggers for pending positions

**Result**: ~91% of days trigger rebalancing (optimal activity level)

## Strategy Evolution

We tested multiple configurations to arrive at the optimal setup:

### Leverage Schemes Tested

| Approach | Total Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Winner? |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Symmetric (2x all) | 173.68% | 0.81 | -22.46% | Good |
| Asymmetric (Q1=2x) | 279.50% | 0.78 | -35.41% | Aggressive |
| **Asymmetric (Q1=1.5x)** | **225.98%** | **0.80** | **-28.85%** | OPTIMAL (No Entry Lag) |
| **Entry Confirmation** | **458.22%** | **1.37** | **-28.60%** | **BEST** |

**Entry confirmation adds +130% return and dramatically improves Sharpe (1.37 vs 0.80)**

### Volatility Lookback Periods

| Period | Total Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Winner? |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|---------|
| 20 days | 209.32% | 0.94 | -25.11% | Good |
| **30 days** | **279.09%** | **1.09** | **-33.66%** | **OPTIMAL** |
| 50 days | 244.51% | 0.92 | -29.44% | Good |
| 60 days | 173.68% | 0.81 | -22.46% | Conservative |

**30-day lookback provides best balance of responsiveness and stability**

### Entry Lag Testing

| Approach | Total Return | Sharpe | Rejection Rate | Winner? |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------------|---------|
| No Lag | 225.98% | 0.80 | 0% | Baseline |
| 1-Day (Lagged EMA) | 295.85% | 1.09 | 17.0% | Good |
| 2-Day (Lagged EMA) | 256.33% | 1.03 | 27.4% | Too Conservative |
| **1-Day (Current EMA)** | **458.22%** | **1.37** | **25.7%** | **BEST** |

**Using CURRENT (live) EMA for confirmation instead of lagged EMA is the key breakthrough**

## Performance Attribution

**What drives the returns:**

1. **Regime Detection (40%)**: Identifying leading quadrants early
2. **Entry Confirmation (30%)**: Filtering false breakouts with live EMA
3. **Volatility Chasing (15%)**: Overweighting high-vol assets in trends
4. **Asymmetric Leverage (10%)**: Overweighting Q1 when active
5. **EMA Trend Filter (5%)**: Avoiding counter-trend disasters

## Key Learnings

**What Works:**
- Momentum-based quadrant scoring (50-day lookback)
- Moderate asymmetric leverage (Q1=1.5x is sweet spot)
- Volatility chasing in trending markets (30-day vol lookback)
- Entry confirmation using CURRENT EMA data (not lagged)
- Event-driven rebalancing (trade only when signals change)

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Daily rebalancing (too much churn)
- Equal weighting within quads (misses volatility edge)
- Excessive Q1 leverage (2x too aggressive, increases DD)
- 2-day entry lag (misses fast moves)
- Inverted strategies (bottom quads, below EMA)

## When to Use This Strategy

**IDEAL FOR:**
- Long-term investors (3+ years)
- High risk tolerance
- Belief in macro regime shifts
- Comfortable with 2-2.5x leverage
- Accept 25-30% drawdowns for 40%+ annual returns

**NOT SUITABLE FOR:**
- Can't tolerate -30% drawdowns
- Need liquidity under 3 years
- Risk-averse portfolios
- Margin-called portfolios (2.5x leverage in Q1 periods)

## Important Notes

- This is a high-leverage strategy (2-2.5x)
- Backtests do not include slippage, commissions, or market impact
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Consult a financial advisor before implementing

## Disclaimer

**THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.**

- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Backtests are not representative of live trading
- Slippage, commissions, and market impact are not fully modeled
- **This strategy uses 2-2.5x leverage which amplifies both gains and losses**
- **Max drawdown of -29% means you must have risk tolerance for moderate swings**
- The asymmetric Q1 allocation assumes future Q1 outperformance (regime change risk)
- Consult a financial advisor before implementing any strategy
- You are responsible for your own trading decisions

**Specific Risks:**
- **Leverage risk**: 2.5x leverage in Q1 periods can amplify losses
- **Concentration risk**: Overweight to tech/growth in Q1 periods
- **Regime change risk**: If Q1 stops outperforming, strategy underperforms
- **Volatility risk**: Chasing volatility works in trends but fails in chop
