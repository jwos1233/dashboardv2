# Macro Quadrant Rotation Strategy - PRODUCTION VERSION

## 🎯 Strategy Overview

**Volatility Chasing with Asymmetric Leverage**

This is an advanced quantitative trading strategy that combines:
1. **Macro Quadrant Analysis** - Identifies market regimes (Q1-Q4) based on growth and inflation
2. **Volatility Chasing** - Dynamically allocates more capital to higher-volatility assets
3. **Asymmetric Leverage** - Overweights the best-performing quadrant (Q1 Goldilocks)
4. **Trend Filtering** - 50-day EMA filter ensures alignment with prevailing trends
5. **Event-Driven Rebalancing** - Only trades when signals change (not on a fixed schedule)

## 🔧 Strategy Components

### 1. Quadrant Classification

The strategy classifies market regimes into 4 quadrants based on momentum signals:

- **Q1 (Goldilocks)**: Growth ↑, Inflation ↓ → Tech/Growth equities, Long-duration bonds
- **Q2 (Reflation)**: Growth ↑, Inflation ↑ → Commodities, Cyclicals, Energy
- **Q3 (Stagflation)**: Growth ↓, Inflation ↑ → Energy, Gold, TIPS, Defensive
- **Q4 (Deflation)**: Growth ↓, Inflation ↓ → Long bonds, Credit, Utilities, Cash

**Quadrant Performance (Historical):**
- **Q1**: +82.70% cumulative (631 days active) 🏆
- **Q3**: +39.54% cumulative (520 days active)
- **Q2**: +34.59% cumulative (467 days active)
- **Q4**: -18.64% cumulative (256 days active)

### 2. Asymmetric Leverage (KEY INNOVATION)

**The Game-Changer**: Not all quadrants are equal. We moderately overweight the winner!

- **Q1 (Goldilocks)**: 150% allocation
- **Q2/Q3/Q4**: 100% allocation each

**Why it works:**
- Q1 has historically been the best-performing quad (+82.70% vs +34-40% for others)
- When Q1 is active, we overweight it 1.5x to capture tech/growth alpha
- When Q1 is not active, we maintain standard 2x leverage (100% + 100%)
- **Optimal balance**: Captures Q1 outperformance without excessive drawdown risk

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Q1 + Q2 Active**: 150% (Q1) + 100% (Q2) = **250% total leverage** 🎯
- **Q1 + Q3 Active**: 150% (Q1) + 100% (Q3) = **250% total leverage**
- **Q2 + Q3 Active**: 100% (Q2) + 100% (Q3) = **200% total leverage** (standard)

**Result**: +105% outperformance vs S&P 500 with manageable drawdowns!

### 3. Volatility Chasing

**Second Innovation**: Allocates **MORE** to volatile assets (opposite of risk parity).

**Why it works:**
- Volatility = Opportunity in trending markets
- Captures explosive moves in high-momentum assets
- 30-day lookback provides optimal balance between responsiveness and stability

**Formula:**
```
Weight_i = (Vol_i / Σ Vol_j) × Quad_Allocation
```

Where higher Vol_i = higher Weight_i (amplifies winning positions)

### 4. EMA Trend Filter

- Only allocates to assets trading **above** their 50-day EMA
- Assets below EMA held as cash (not redistributed)
- Prevents allocation to assets in downtrends
- Automatic deleveraging during market stress

### 5. Event-Driven Rebalancing

Trades only when:
1. Top 2 quadrants change, **OR**
2. An asset crosses its 50-day EMA (up or down)

**Result**: ~69% of days trigger rebalancing (optimal activity level)

## 🔬 Strategy Evolution

We tested multiple configurations to arrive at the optimal setup:

### Leverage Schemes Tested

| Approach | Total Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Winner? |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Symmetric (2x all) | 173.68% | 0.81 | -22.46% | Good |
| Asymmetric (Q1=2x) | 279.50% | 0.78 | -35.41% | Aggressive |
| **Asymmetric (Q1=1.5x)** | **225.98%** | **0.80** | **-28.85%** | ✅ **OPTIMAL** |

**Q1=1.5x is the sweet spot!** Captures most of the alpha (+52% more than symmetric) while keeping drawdowns manageable (-29% vs -35% with Q1=2x).

### Volatility Lookback Periods

| Period | Total Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Winner? |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|---------|
| 20-day | 160.8% | 0.77 | -23.6% | |
| **30-day** | **169.8%** | **0.80** | **-22.5%** | ✅ **OPTIMAL** |
| 50-day | 165.3% | 0.78 | -23.1% | |
| 60-day | 163.6% | 0.78 | -23.2% | |

**30-day won on all key metrics (before asymmetric leverage).**

### Asset Universe Tests

| Universe | Tickers | Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Winner? |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Lite | 16 | 66.0% | 0.64 | -28.31% | |
| **Original** | **35** | **279.5%** | **0.78** | **-35.41%** | ✅ **BEST** |
| Expanded | 56 | 95.8% | 0.53 | -40.63% | Worse |

**35 tickers = optimal sweet spot (quality over quantity).**

## ⚙️ Strategy Mechanics

### Daily Process

1. **Morning (T-1)**:
   - Calculate 50-day momentum for quadrant indicators (Q1-Q4)
   - Determine top 2 quadrants by momentum score
   - Calculate 30-day volatility for all 35 assets
   - Check if rebalancing is needed (quad change or EMA cross)

2. **If Rebalancing Needed**:
   - For each of top 2 quads:
     - Determine base allocation: **Q1 = 200%**, **Q2/Q3/Q4 = 100%**
     - Get assets in that quad
     - Calculate volatility weights (higher vol = higher weight)
     - Apply 50-day EMA filter (only allocate if price > EMA)
   - Generate target portfolio (200-300% leverage when fully invested)

3. **Trade Execution (T)**:
   - Rebalance to target weights
   - Assets below EMA → held as cash (automatic deleveraging)

### Example Allocation (Q1 + Q3 Active)

**Q1 (200% allocation - DOUBLE!):**
- ARKK: 50% vol → **80% weight** (volatile = high allocation × Q1 multiplier)
- QQQ: 30% vol → **48% weight**
- XLC: 20% vol → **32% weight**
- Below EMA: 40% cash

**Q3 (100% allocation - STANDARD):**
- FCG: 60% vol → **35% weight** (highest vol)
- XLE: 45% vol → **26% weight**
- GLD: 40% vol → **23% weight**
- Below EMA: 16% cash

**Total Portfolio: 244% allocated, 56% cash**

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Best For:
✅ Aggressive traders seeking **maximum absolute returns**  
✅ Those who can stomach **30-35% drawdowns**  
✅ Belief that "volatility = opportunity"  
✅ Trend-following / momentum mindset  
✅ **5+ year investment horizon** (to ride through volatility)  
✅ High conviction in Q1 (Goldilocks) regime outperformance  

### Not Ideal For:
❌ Conservative investors  
❌ Those requiring stable monthly returns  
❌ Can't tolerate -30%+ drawdowns  
❌ Need liquidity < 3 years  
❌ Risk-averse portfolios  
❌ Margin-called portfolios (3x leverage in Q1 periods!)  

## 📊 Risk Metrics

- **Volatility**: 23.20% (moderate, expected with 2-2.5x leverage)
- **Max Drawdown**: -28.85% (occurred in 2022-2023 period)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.80 (excellent risk-adjusted returns)
- **Win Rate**: ~37% of days positive (momentum = streaky)
- **Rebalance Frequency**: 68.7% (active but controlled)
- **Leverage**: 200-250% gross (2-2.5x depending on quad mix)

**Risk Management Built-In:**
- EMA filter automatically deleverages in downtrends
- Cash held when assets below EMA (reduces leverage in bear markets)
- Event-driven rebalancing prevents whipsaw losses

## 🔄 Alternative Configurations

If the production version is too aggressive, consider:

### Moderate (Symmetric 2x Leverage):
```bash
python quad_portfolio_backtest_volchase.py
```
- Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 all get 100% allocation (2x total)
- 173.68% return, 0.81 Sharpe, -22.46% max DD
- Best for those who want leverage without Q1 concentration

### Conservative (Risk Parity):
```bash
python quad_portfolio_backtest_volweight.py
```
- Uses **inverse** volatility (lower vol = higher weight)
- 85% return, 0.83 Sharpe, -17.6% max DD
- Best for risk-averse investors

### Experiment:
```bash
python compare_vol_lookbacks.py
```
- Tests 20/30/50/60 day periods
- Generates comparison charts
- Helps optimize for your risk tolerance

4. **Adjust filters** (EMA period, momentum lookback, etc.)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.**

- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Backtests are not representative of live trading
- Slippage, commissions, and market impact are not fully modeled
- **This strategy uses 2-2.5x leverage which amplifies both gains and losses**
- **Max drawdown of -29% means you must have risk tolerance for moderate swings**
- The asymmetric Q1 allocation assumes future Q1 outperformance (regime change risk)
- Consult a financial advisor before implementing any strategy
- You are responsible for your own trading decisions

**Specific Risks:**
- **Leverage risk**: 2.5x leverage in Q1 periods can amplify losses
- **Concentration risk**: Overweight to tech/growth in Q1 periods
- **Regime change risk**: If Q1 stops outperforming, strategy underperforms
- **Volatility risk**: Chasing volatility works in trends but fails in chop
